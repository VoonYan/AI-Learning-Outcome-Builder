    "This notebook serves as interactive way to view the teams procedure in conducting the efficacy of the AI tool developed for the purposes of this project. The main purpose of these tests are to evaluate the AI's ability to accurately classify unit learning outcomes according to Bloom's taxonomy and in line with expert review as well as grading the quality of the AI's rewrite ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will go step by step in demonstrating each test conducted by the team, the tests can be executed individually with notation explaining the purpose and methodology for each test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step was to gather the data sources used to perform the test. As agreed upon and recorded in meetings between the team and the client, it was agreed that the client would consult experts and provide a set of flagged learning outcomes to serve as the test set for our AI in addition to a larger set of data for unit learning outcomes. Using this dataset, we can perform tests like F1 score, confusion matrix and ROUGE score to evaluate the AI's capabilities."

    "### Pre-Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can construct the AI tests, we must first clean the data provided to us. For the test csv data used, we constructed a SQL query to create a table with unit information and corresponding learning outcomes, copying that joined table to a CSV. This CSV contained the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unit-id: The unique id attributed to each id in the Unit table.\n",
    "- Unit code: A unique 8 digit code attributed to units by UWA for each conducted hosted by UWA.\n",
    "- Level: The course \"level\" of each unit, indicating the complexity of each unit.\n",
    "- Description: Each unit has a set of learning outcomes associated with it, in our website these outcomes are stored in their own separate table. In our case, we've joined basic unit info with each learning outcome. Each learning outcome is a description of a goal that the unit should provide student or a skill that will be assessed.\n",
    "- Position: This parameter is mainly used for front end rendering on the learning outcome editor page, indicating the position of a learning outcome in the table.\n",
    "- Credit Points: The completion of each unit corresponds to a certain number of credit points added towards a student, the completion of a degree typically involves the completion of certain units as well as a requisite number of credit points.\n",
    "\n",
    "After extracting this data into a CSV, a manual review was performed for each learning outcome, and an addition column was added.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flag: This parameter indicates human analysis of learning outcomes, and categorises learning outcomes into three levels, 'Good', 'Needs Revision' and 'Could Improve'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of cleaning is to load this CSV into Python using a pandas dataframe."
